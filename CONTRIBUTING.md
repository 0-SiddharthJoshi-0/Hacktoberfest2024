# Contribution rules

- Project must work when opening index.html
- You are allowed to make pull requests that break the rules. We just will merge it ;)
- Do NOT add any build steps e.g npm install (we want to keep this a simple static site)
- Do NOT remove any other content.
- Styling / code can be pretty, ugly or stupid, big or small as long as it works
- Add your name to the Contributors.html file
